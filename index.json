The most common use case of sentiment analysis is on analysing product or service reviews that are made available on the internet but it is increasingly being used in research that aims to quantify public sentiment or opinion. In the advent of Web 2.0 and wide use of various social media platforms alongside much affordable access to increased computing power for most people, the use of sentiment analysis has increased and expanded to various fields such as stock and financial markets, elections, extreme events and disaster, medicine, and policy analysis 3.\nUsing the text data on IATF resolutions available from the covidphtext package we developed, we explore the use of sentiment analysis as one of several natural language processing (NLP), text analysis and computational linguistics techniques we plan to use for assessing Philippine government policy with regard to the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The following workflow illustrates the process we use:\n  {\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"\\n digraph sentimentAnalysis {\\n\\n # a \\\"graph\\\" statement\\n graph [overlap = false, fontsize = 14, fontname = Helvetica]\\n\\n # Terminal nodes\\n node [shape = oval, width = 1.5, penwidth = 1.5]\\n \\n a [label = \\\"Start\\\"];\\n g [label = \\\"End\\\"];\\n\\n # Input/output nodes\\n node [shape = parallelogram, height = 1, width = 1.5, penwidth = 1.5]\\n \\n b [label = \\\"1. covidphtext\\ntext data\\\"];\\n f [label = \\\"5.

What we need to do now is to combine all resolutions into a single dataset. There is a convenience function in covidphtext that helps with this called combine_iatf and is used as follows:\nallText \u0026lt;- covidphtext::combine_iatf(res = c(1:15, 17:46)) You will notice that we left out IATF Resolution No.Â 16..

We then consider whether all the sections of a resolution is going to be useful for sentiment analysis. A typical resolution is composed of 3 sections:\n Heading - contains the body proposing the resolution, the subject of the resolution, the resolution number and the date resolution is issued;\n Preambulatory clauses - contains the preamble statements of the resolution i.e., the reasons for which the proposing body is addressing the issue and highlights past action done by the body or any other organisation regarding the issue. This is usually composed of a series of phrases that starts with the WHEREAS\n Operative clauses - contains phrases/statements that offer solutions to the issues stated in the preamble.These phrases are action-oriented starting with a verb followed by the proposed solution. This section usually starts off with LET IT BE RESOLVED\n  The IATF Resolutions very much follow the aforementioned structure with the addition of a section stating the approval of the resolution and the signatories approving the resolution, and in later resolutions a section certifying that the resolution has been approved.\nFor purposes of sentiment analysis, the most meaningful sections to use will be the sections on preambulatory clauses and operative clauses. So, we further subset the concatenated text dataset of IATF Resolutions to only contain those that are preambulatory and operative clauses. You will notice that in the text data of each of the IATF Resolutions, these sections have been identified through the variable named section. We use this variable to filter the sections we need as follows:\nallText \u0026lt;- allText %\u0026gt;% filter(section %in% c(\u0026quot;preamble\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;operative\u0026quot;)) which results in\n## # A tibble: 4,048 x 7 ## linenumber text source type id section date ## \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;date\u0026gt; ## 1 11 WHEREAS, Executive Order Nâ€¦ IATF resolâ€¦ 1 preambâ€¦ 2020-01-28 ## 2 12 for the Management of Emerâ€¦ IATF resolâ€¦ 1 preambâ€¦ 2020-01-28 ## 3 13 WHEREAS, the Inter-agency â€¦ IATF resolâ€¦ 1 preambâ€¦ 2020-01-28 ## 4 14 identify, screen, and assiâ€¦ IATF resolâ€¦ 1 preambâ€¦ 2020-01-28 ## 5 15 prevent and/or minimize thâ€¦ IATF resolâ€¦ 1 preambâ€¦ 2020-01-28 ## 6 16 as prevent and/or minimizeâ€¦ IATF resolâ€¦ 1 preambâ€¦ 2020-01-28 ## 7 17 WHEREAS, on January 7, 202â€¦ IATF resolâ€¦ 1 preambâ€¦ 2020-01-28 ## 8 18 the viral pneumonia outbreâ€¦ IATF resolâ€¦ 1 preambâ€¦ 2020-01-28 ## 9 19 (2019-nCoV) that has not bâ€¦ IATF resolâ€¦ 1 preambâ€¦ 2020-01-28 ## 10 20 WHEREAS, as of January 27,â€¦ IATF resolâ€¦ 1 preambâ€¦ 2020-01-28 ## # â€¦ with 4,038 more rows We are now left with 4048 rows of text for sentiment analysis.\nFinally, we perform some final data cleaning and processing that will be useful when performing sentiment analysis. We convert the word COVID-19 to COVID19 without the dash. Since this word will most likely be a critical word in this analysis, we wanted to ensure that we capture it in its entirety. The next step on tokenisation removes any punctuation used in the text including dashes and will treat COVID as a separate word from 19. We remove the dash prior to tokenisation so that we can keep these two as one word.\nallText$text \u0026lt;- str_replace_all(string = allText$text, pattern = \u0026quot;COVID-19\u0026quot;, replacement = \u0026quot;COVID19\u0026quot;) And then, anticipating that we will need some kind of grouping variable later in the analysis, we create a month variable within the concatenated text dataset that indicates the month when a specific resolution was issued. This was done as follows:\nallText \u0026lt;- allText %\u0026gt;% mutate(month = factor(x = months(date), levels = c(\u0026quot;January\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;February\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;March\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;April\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;May\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;June\u0026quot;))) Our final working text dataset is this:\n## # A tibble: 4,048 x 8 ## linenumber text source type id section date month ## \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;date\u0026gt; \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; ## 1 11 WHEREAS, Executive Oâ€¦ IATF resolâ€¦ 1 preambâ€¦ 2020-01-28 Januâ€¦ ## 2 12 for the Management oâ€¦ IATF resolâ€¦ 1 preambâ€¦ 2020-01-28 Januâ€¦ ## 3 13 WHEREAS, the Inter-aâ€¦ IATF resolâ€¦ 1 preambâ€¦ 2020-01-28 Januâ€¦ ## 4 14 identify, screen, anâ€¦ IATF resolâ€¦ 1 preambâ€¦ 2020-01-28 Januâ€¦ ## 5 15 prevent and/or minimâ€¦ IATF resolâ€¦ 1 preambâ€¦ 2020-01-28 Januâ€¦ ## 6 16 as prevent and/or miâ€¦ IATF resolâ€¦ 1 preambâ€¦ 2020-01-28 Januâ€¦ ## 7 17 WHEREAS, on January â€¦ IATF resolâ€¦ 1 preambâ€¦ 2020-01-28 Januâ€¦ ## 8 18 the viral pneumonia â€¦ IATF resolâ€¦ 1 preambâ€¦ 2020-01-28 Januâ€¦ ## 9 19 (2019-nCoV) that hasâ€¦ IATF resolâ€¦ 1 preambâ€¦ 2020-01-28 Januâ€¦ ## 10 20 WHEREAS, as of Januaâ€¦ IATF resolâ€¦ 1 preambâ€¦ 2020-01-28 Januâ€¦ ## # â€¦ with 4,038 more rows  Step 2: Tokenise data We are now ready to tokenise the data. Tokenisation of text data simply means structuring the text data into tokens â€“ meaningful units of text such as a word, or groups of words, or a sentence, or a paragraph. For sentiment analysis, the most useful token will be a word mainly because the sentiment lexicons (see following section for definition) we plan to use are based on words.\nWe use the tidytext package and the function unnest_tokens within it to perform tokenisation using words as follows:\ntidy_resolutions \u0026lt;- allText %\u0026gt;% unnest_tokens(output = word, input = text) This results in the following dataset:\n## # A tibble: 40,024 x 8 ## linenumber source type id section date month word ## \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;date\u0026gt; \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 11 IATF resolution 1 preamble 2020-01-28 January whereas ## 2 11 IATF resolution 1 preamble 2020-01-28 January executive ## 3 11 IATF resolution 1 preamble 2020-01-28 January order ## 4 11 IATF resolution 1 preamble 2020-01-28 January no ## 5 11 IATF resolution 1 preamble 2020-01-28 January 168 ## 6 11 IATF resolution 1 preamble 2020-01-28 January s ## 7 11 IATF resolution 1 preamble 2020-01-28 January 2014 ## 8 11 IATF resolution 1 preamble 2020-01-28 January creates ## 9 11 IATF resolution 1 preamble 2020-01-28 January the ## 10 11 IATF resolution 1 preamble 2020-01-28 January inter ## # â€¦ with 40,014 more rows You will notice that our new tokenised dataset is structured such that each word in the concatenated IATF Resolutions of preambles and operative clauses is a unit of data i.e.Â in a row. We now have a dataset with 40024 rows and 8 columns that we can use for the next step.\n Step 3: Apply sentiment lexicon We now apply a sentiment lexicon onto the tokenised dataset from the previous step. Sentiment lexicons are basically a list of common words in a specific language with each word having a value pertaining to the sentiment or emotion associated with a specific word. The value assigned to a word can be binary i.e.Â negative or positive, or can be categories of sentiments or emotions such as positive, negative, anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust, or a numerical value on a scale that runs from negative values indicating progressively negative sentiments to positive values indicating progressively positive sentiments.\nThe tidytext package comes with three general use lexicons:\n AFINN - from Finn Ã…rup Nielsen which is a lexicon that assigns a score to words from -5 to +5 with negative scores indicating negative sentiments and positive scores indicating positive sentiments;\n bing - from Bing Liu and collaborators which is a lexicon that simply classifies words into either negative or positive categories; and,\n nrc - from Saif Mohammad and Peter Turney which is a lexicon that groups words into categories of positive, negative, anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or trust\n  We apply the sentiment lexicon from Bing and colleagues to our tokenised data as follows:\nresolution_sentiment \u0026lt;- tidy_resolutions %\u0026gt;% inner_join(get_sentiments(\u0026quot;bing\u0026quot;)) What we are basically doing here is to match the words in our tokenised data with the words in the sentiment lexicion from Bing and colleagues to get the sentiment value of positive or negative for our tokenised data. This results in the following:\n## # A tibble: 1,303 x 9 ## linenumber source type id section date month word sentiment ## \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;date\u0026gt; \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 14 IATF resoluâ€¦ 1 preamble 2020-01-28 Januaâ€¦ infected negative ## 2 15 IATF resoluâ€¦ 1 preamble 2020-01-28 Januaâ€¦ well positive ## 3 18 IATF resoluâ€¦ 1 preamble 2020-01-28 Januaâ€¦ outbreak negative ## 4 21 IATF resoluâ€¦ 1 preamble 2020-01-28 Januaâ€¦ risk negative ## 5 21 IATF resoluâ€¦ 1 preamble 2020-01-28 Januaâ€¦ infectiâ€¦ negative ## 6 25 IATF resoluâ€¦ 1 operatiâ€¦ 2020-01-28 Januaâ€¦ recommeâ€¦ positive ## 7 26 IATF resoluâ€¦ 1 operatiâ€¦ 2020-01-28 Januaâ€¦ support positive ## 8 26 IATF resoluâ€¦ 1 operatiâ€¦ 2020-01-28 Januaâ€¦ accurate positive ## 9 27 IATF resoluâ€¦ 1 operatiâ€¦ 2020-01-28 Januaâ€¦ timely positive ## 10 27 IATF resoluâ€¦ 1 operatiâ€¦ 2020-01-28 Januaâ€¦ support positive ## # â€¦ with 1,293 more rows  Figure 2: Sentiment analysis of IATF resolutions  The resolutions over time generally starts off on a positive note (except for resolution 14 on 20 March 2020 and resolution 15 on 25 March 2020).\nEarly on in the pandemic, in the first two weeks of March 2020 (resolutions up to 17 March 2020), the resolutions generally starts off on a mildly positive note but almost immediately gets to a more negative sentiment as the resolution progresses to the end. This is particularly evident in the first two resolution in the first week of March. By the second week of March, some small spikes of positivity is noted towards the end of the resolutions but still with a more negative tone at the end.\nBy the second week of March 2020 up to early April 2020, there is a shift to a mostly more positive sentiment to the resolutions right from the start. A few sharp troughs of negativity on the 25th of March and the 3rd of April 2020 can be noted.\n Figure 3: Words that contribute to positive and negative sentiment in the IATF resolutions   Figure 4: Average sentiment value for IATF resolutions by month   Figure 5: Sentiment value across all resolutions by month   Figure 6: The most common words in the IATF resolutions   Figure 7: Most common positive and negative word in the IATF resolutions  \n  MÃ¤ntylÃ¤ MV, Graziotin D, Kuutila M.

Several groups and individuals within the Philippines have proferred predictions on the course of the pandemic in the country. Particularly, these groups or individuals have predicted through their models the possible effects of various non-pharmaceutical interventions on the evolution of the pandemic particularly on the numbers of cases and deaths and their temporal and spatial distribution. Based on these, they have offered recommendations on what should be done further to mitigate these predicted outcomes. On the other hand, the national government has indicated that it will make policies and take action based on scientific evidence and has even commissioned a team of scientists to specifically perform mathenmatical modelling to generate this scientific evidence to guide its policy making.\nWe propose to quantify the impact of the best available scientific evidence with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic on the policies formulated and enacted by the Philippine government.

We knew it was always going to be a balance between having the most ideal sources of text data for what we want to do and those sources that could be mined of their text data in a reasonably efficient way.\nIn our search for sources, we found out about the IATF and its role/mandate to respond to the issues concerning emerging infectious diseases in the Philippines. The IATF was convened in early January 2020 in response to the growing outbreak in Wuhan, China. Since then, we found that the task force has released several resolutions that reflected the national governmentâ€™s on-going assessment of the evolution and spread of COVID-19 and itâ€™s intended response. Given this, we felt that the IATF resolutions were the key manifestation of the national governmentâ€™s overarching policy with regard go the COVID-19 pandemic from which other more detailed and specific departmental and sub-national policies were derived from.\nWe noted that the Department of Health, which chairs the IATF, have routinely uploaded to their website copies of resolutions once they have been formally endorsed and signed by all departmental members. We later found out that IATF resolutions were also released via the countryâ€™s official journal, The Official Gazette, online via its website. Based on these considerations, we decided to focus on using the IATF resolutions for our policy analysis project.\nThe next challenge was how to extract the text from these resolutions into a data structure and format useful for text analysis and topic modelling. In this post, we describe how we used the R language for statistical computing to develop a supervised text extraction workflow described in the diagram below:\n  {\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"\\n graph TD\\n X(START) -- A[1. Download PDF] \\n A -- B[2. Read PDF]\\n B -- C[3. Clean text data]\\n C -- D[4. Structure text data]\\n D -- E[5. Save data]\\n E -- Y(END)\\n \"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]} Figure 1: Text extraction workflow in R  Step 1: Downloading the resolutions The resolutions are available either from the DoH website or from The Official Gazette website. There are two key differences between these two sources. First, the DoH only provides resolutions starting from March 2020 at Resolution No.Â 9. Second, the DoH uploads the most recent resolutions a little bit later than The Official Gazette.\nWe automated the bulk download of all available resolutions from either sources in R by first creating a function that reads the HTML page/s for the resolutions and extracting the download links/URLs for each available resolution. Then, using these links, we created another function that downloads the PDFs into a temporary directory which can then be accessed for the next step of the workflow.\nExtracting download links/URLs of resolutions To extract download links/URLs of resolutions from either sources, we created wrappers around web scraping functions in the rvest package.\nFor the resolutions in the DoH website, we created the function get_iatf_links. This function only requires a single argument termed base which is the URL of the DoH webpage for IATF resolutions. The current URL for this is at https://www.doh.gov.ph/COVID-19/IATF-Resolutions and this is what is used as default value for base. So, to get the links/URLs for the resolutions found in the DoH website, we use:\nget_iatf_links() which gives the following:\n## # A tibble: 41 x 7 ## id title date source type url checked ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;date\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;date\u0026gt; ## 1 9 Recommendations fâ€¦ 2020-03-03 IATF resoâ€¦ https://doh.gov.â€¦ 2020-06-17 ## 2 10 Recommendations fâ€¦ 2020-03-09 IATF resoâ€¦ https://doh.gov.â€¦ 2020-06-17 ## 3 11 Recommendations fâ€¦ 2020-03-12 IATF resoâ€¦ https://doh.gov.â€¦ 2020-06-17 ## 4 12 Recommendations fâ€¦ 2020-03-13 IATF resoâ€¦ https://doh.gov.â€¦ 2020-06-17 ## 5 13 Recommendations fâ€¦ 2020-03-17 IATF resoâ€¦ https://doh.gov.â€¦ 2020-06-17 ## 6 14 Resolutions Relatâ€¦ 2020-03-20 IATF resoâ€¦ https://doh.gov.â€¦ 2020-06-17 ## 7 15 Resolutions Relatâ€¦ 2020-03-25 IATF resoâ€¦ https://doh.gov.â€¦ 2020-06-17 ## 8 16 Additional Guidelâ€¦ 2020-03-30 IATF resoâ€¦ https://doh.gov.â€¦ 2020-06-17 ## 9 17 Recommendations Râ€¦ 2020-03-30 IATF resoâ€¦ https://doh.gov.â€¦ 2020-06-17 ## 10 18 Recommendations Râ€¦ 2020-04-01 IATF resoâ€¦ https://doh.gov.â€¦ 2020-06-17 ## # â€¦ with 31 more rows The result is a tibble with 7 columns and the number of rows equal to the number of resolutions available from the DoH website on the day the output was produced. The column named checked in the output indicates when it was produced. The number of rows of the output may change between two calls to this function as newer resolution/s may have been uploaded from the time the first call was made to the time the second call was made.\nFor the resolutions in The Official Gazette, we created the get_iatf_gazette function. As with the get_iatf_links function, this requires the URL to the IATF resolutions webpage in The Official Gazette which is set at https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/section/laws/other-issuances/inter-agency-task-force-for-the-management-of-emerging-infectious-diseases-resolutions/. However, a second argument named pages is required. Unlike the DoH page that has all the download links to the resolutions available on a single page, The Official Gazette uses pagination to split the information on download links into multiple pages. To be able to get the links of all the resolutions, we would need to supply a vector of the page numbers of all the pages that contains the download links. So, to get the links/URLs for all available resolutions found in the The Official Gazette website, we use:\nget_iatf_gazette(pages = 1:6) after determining from the website that the download links are contained in 6 pages.\nThis gives the following result:\n## # A tibble: 53 x 7 ## id title date source type url checked ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;date\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;date\u0026gt; ## 1 46 RESOLUTION NO. 46â€¦ 2020-06-15 IATF resoâ€¦ https://www.offiâ€¦ 2020-06-17 ## 2 46 RESOLUTION NO. 46â€¦ 2020-06-15 IATF resoâ€¦ https://www.offiâ€¦ 2020-06-17 ## 3 45 RESOLUTION NO. 45â€¦ 2020-06-10 IATF resoâ€¦ https://www.offiâ€¦ 2020-06-17 ## 4 44 RESOLUTION NO. 44â€¦ 2020-06-08 IATF resoâ€¦ https://www.offiâ€¦ 2020-06-17 ## 5 NA OMNIBUS GUIDELINEâ€¦ 2020-06-03 IATF resoâ€¦ https://www.offiâ€¦ 2020-06-17 ## 6 43 RESOLUTION NO. 43â€¦ 2020-06-03 IATF resoâ€¦ https://www.offiâ€¦ 2020-06-17 ## 7 42 RESOLUTION NO. 42â€¦ 2020-06-01 IATF resoâ€¦ https://www.offiâ€¦ 2020-06-17 ## 8 41 RESOLUTION NO. 41â€¦ 2020-05-29 IATF resoâ€¦ https://www.offiâ€¦ 2020-06-17 ## 9 40 RESOLUTION NO. 40â€¦ 2020-05-27 IATF resoâ€¦ https://www.offiâ€¦ 2020-06-17 ## 10 NA OMNIBUS GUIDELINEâ€¦ 2020-05-22 IATF resoâ€¦ https://www.offiâ€¦ 2020-06-17 ## # â€¦ with 43 more rows Notice that the ouput is the same in class and structure as the output of the previous function the only difference being that this produces more rows. This is because, as already mentioned earlier, The Official Gazette has the first 8 resolutions issued in January and February 2020 and is updated soon after resolutions are endorsed and signed by the IATF compared to that of the DoH.\n Downloading the resolutions The most important information from the output from either functions is the column named url as this contains the links/URLs to the PDFs of the various resolutions.\nWe automated the download of the resolution PDFs from the DoH site using a convenience function called get_iatf_pdf. In this function, the user can choose which specific resolution to download by specifying the argument id. If the user wants to download the PDF for Resolution No.Â 29, the following call is made:\niatfLinks %\u0026gt;% get_iatf_pdf(id = 29) which gives the following output:\n## [1] \u0026quot;/var/folders/rx/nr32tl5n6f3d_86tn0tc7kc00000gp/T//RtmpEQY0KS/iatfResolution29.pdf\u0026quot; The output is a character vector of the path to the temporary directory created where the PDF for Resolution No.Â 29 has been stored under the filename iatfResolution29.pdf.\nIt is considered best practice for a function that downloads something from the internet to save this download into a temporary directory as this is more secure and potentially less harmful for the user. It is also advantageous for the user as the PDFs do not have to be saved into the local computer but instead immediately read and used in R.\n  Steps 2, 3 and 4: Reading, cleaning and structuring text data from the resolutions These steps form the supervised component of the workflow.\nUsing the output from the previous step, the PDF/s can be read into R using the pdftools package. Typically, reading a PDF with pdftools would be as straightforward as:\npdftools::pdf_text(pdf = \u0026quot;PATH/TO/PDF\u0026quot;) However, the IATF resolutions have been released as downloadable PDF documents produced by scanning the hard copy, signed versions of the resolutions. This type of PDF requires a different function from the pdftools package to extract the data:\npdftools::pdf_ocr_text(pdf = \u0026quot;PATH/TO/SCANNED/PDF\u0026quot;) Whilst this type of document format can be read by pdftools package, the extracted text often requires a lot of manual cleaning and some words or phrases needing to be edited. Below is an example raw output after reading the PDF of IATF Resolution No.Â 29 and adding some linebreaks.\niatfLinks %\u0026gt;% ## Reference iatfLinks table get_iatf_pdf(id = 29) %\u0026gt;% ## Download PDF of Resolution 29 pdftools::pdf_ocr_text() %\u0026gt;% ## Extract text using OCR stringr::str_split(pattern = \u0026quot;\\n\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% ## Split lines of text unlist() %\u0026gt;% ## Unlist to create data.frame head(n = 30) ## Show first 30 rows/lines of text ## Converting page 1 to iatfResolution29_1.png... done! ## Converting page 2 to iatfResolution29_2.png... done! ## Converting page 3 to iatfResolution29_3.png... done! ## Converting page 4 to iatfResolution29_4.png... done! ## [1] \u0026quot;g \\\\ REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES\u0026quot; ## [2] \u0026quot;\u0026quot; ## [3] \u0026quot;; ay ; INTER-AGENCY TASK FORCE\u0026quot; ## [4] \u0026quot;\u0026quot; ## [5] \u0026quot;%, - FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES\u0026quot; ## [6] \u0026quot;â€œit Ore on Emer\u0026quot; ## [7] \u0026quot;\u0026quot; ## [8] \u0026quot;RESOLUTION NO. 29\u0026quot; ## [9] \u0026quot;Series of 2020\u0026quot; ## [10] \u0026quot;April 27, 2020\u0026quot; ## [11] \u0026quot;RECOMMENDATIONS RELATIVE TO THE MANAGEMENT\u0026quot; ## [12] \u0026quot;OF THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) SITUATION\u0026quot; ## [13] \u0026quot;\u0026quot; ## [14] \u0026quot;WHEREAS, on March 16, 2020, to prevent the sharp rise of COVID-19 cases in the\u0026quot; ## [15] \u0026quot;country, the President placed the entirety of Luzon under Enhanced Community Quarantine until\u0026quot; ## [16] \u0026quot;April 14, 2020;\u0026quot; ## [17] \u0026quot;\u0026quot; ## [18] \u0026quot;WHEREAS, on March 30, 2020, to develop a science-based approach in determining\u0026quot; ## [19] \u0026quot;whether the Enhanced Community Quarantine in Luzon should be totally or partially lifted,\u0026quot; ## [20] \u0026quot;extended, or expanded to other areas, the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) convened a\u0026quot; ## [21] \u0026quot;sub-Technical Working Group tasked to define parameters in assessing recent developments in\u0026quot; ## [22] \u0026quot;the Philippine COVID-19 situation;\u0026quot; ## [23] \u0026quot;\u0026quot; ## [24] \u0026quot;WHEREAS, on April 3, 2020, the [ATF finalized the parameters for deciding on the\u0026quot; ## [25] \u0026quot;lifting or extension of the Enhanced Community Quarantine in Luzon, which include trends on\u0026quot; ## [26] \u0026quot;the COVID-19 epidemiological curve, the health capacity of the country, social factors,\u0026quot; ## [27] \u0026quot;economic factors, and security factors;\u0026quot; ## [28] \u0026quot;\u0026quot; ## [29] \u0026quot;WHEREAS, on April 7, 2020, upon the recommendation of the IATF, the President\u0026quot; ## [30] \u0026quot;extended the implementation of the Enhanced Community Quarantine over the entirety of Luzon\u0026quot; This is the reason why Steps 2, 3 and 4 cannot be automated algorithmically or in an unsupervised approach.\nFollowing is the complete script used to read, clean and structure Resolution No.Â 29 in a manner that is amenable for text analysis:\n## Read and re-structure text data y \u0026lt;- iatfLinks %\u0026gt;% ## Reference iatfLinks table get_iatf_pdf(id = 29) %\u0026gt;% ## Download PDF of Resolution 29 pdftools::pdf_ocr_text() %\u0026gt;% ## Extract text using OCR stringr::str_split(pattern = \u0026quot;\\n\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% ## Split lines of text unlist() ## Unlist to create data.frame ## Restructure text and clean y \u0026lt;- y[c(14:48, 55:90, 98:109, 115:149)] y \u0026lt;- y[y != \u0026quot;\u0026quot;] y[69] \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;Francisco T.
